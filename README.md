## Project Objectives

- Understand the structure of a real-world medical dataset
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Apply basic statistical concepts
- Build a simple prediction model
- Interpret results clearly

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains medical information related to diabetes, such as:
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- BMI
- Age
- Outcome (Diabetic / Non-Diabetic)

The data is used to analyse patterns and predict the likelihood of diabetes.
